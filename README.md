# Solex: Solar Exploration in 3D

## Inspiration
I have a passion for 3D environment, motion design, and VR. Aligned with the hackathon's theme, I am inspired to use 3D environment and motion design to create a fun way to explore the solar system and learn new facts. Having taken one astrophysics class, I am bothered by the fact that the solar system is often presented in 2D in books when it is a 3-dimensional object. Reading books alone cannot help me imagine how a planet looks like if seen from its surface. With that in mind, I decided to create a 3D version of the solar system to help give a better picture of what the solar system and planets look like as seen from the surface. My hope is that Solex can inspire future astronauts to explore and discover more planets!

## What it does
Solex is a lightweight, interactive solar system simulator used to demonstrate the solar system, the planets, and their features. Solex presents the solar system in 3D, so a user can look at the solar system from different angles. 

Solex comes with 3D models of the 9 (if you count Pluto as a planet) planets of the solar system. The models are made as close to reality as possible. Solex allows its users to land on a planet and look at the planet from the surface, provided that it is safe to land on the planet in reality. This feature allows Solex users to get a more realistic image of the planets in the solar system, which cannot be presented in books.

Solex also presents fun facts both on the solar system and the planets. When a user visits a planet, a fun fact on the visited planet will be presented to the user. This feature allows users to learn about the planet they visit in a more fun, gamified way, which cannot be experienced through books.

## How we built it
I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the landing page. I used a JavaScript library called ThreeJS to render 3D objects such as the planets in a web browser. 

I also used the following open source projects to help me with creating the planets and the environment:

1. [Free UV maps of planets]( https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/)
2. [Free skyboxes](https://opengameart.org/content/skiingpenguins-skybox-pack)

## Challenges I ran into
1. I had challenges looking for teammates, mainly because I participate virtually. It took me about 3 hours before I decided to just work on this solo.
2. The last time I coded in JavaScript and used ThreeJS was last year. So, at first, I had to spend some time opening documentations and switching between my browser and IDE. But, after 1-2 hours, I was able to pick the languages up quickly.
3. I also had difficulties creating UV maps of planets. I attempted to create the models myself. Luckily, I ran into the open source projects (mentioned above) that provide free resources.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
1. I finished the project under the 24-hour time constraint. Solex has three features that are working really well, and I am proud of that.
2. I was able to learn ThreeJS a little deeper. Now, I find it easier to control the movement of the camera. This is something I struggled with before.
3. I am proud of being productive on a Saturday.
4. I consider this app a success if at least one person spends at least 3 minutes exploring the website.
5. I am proud of being able to connect my site to the domain.com domain. Usually, this took me about 30 minutes to configure and about 6-8 hours to check its success. This weekend the whole process took me just about 30 minutes from configuration to deployment.

## What I learned
1. I learned how to combine UV maps to primitive 3D objects in ThreeJS.
2. I learned how to control a camera in ThreeJS.
3. I learned how to connect a domain.com domain to a GitHub page/Vercel.

## What's next for Solex
1. My vision is to create a character in the game. A user can then control the character. The character can walk on the planet and visit certain places.
2. I also want to make more objects on each planet. For instance, on Earth, I would create 3D models of remarkable places such as the seven wonders of the world, or the Eiffel Tower, or the Tower of Pisa, etc.
